Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. It is known for its robust data model, powerful query language (PromQL), and the ability to generate alerts based on the collected time-series data. It can be configured and set up on both bare-metal servers and container environments like Kubernetes.

**Prometheus Web UI** allows users to explore the collected metrics data, run ad-hoc PromQL queries, and visualize the results directly within Prometheus.
**Grafana** is a powerful dashboard and visualization tool that integrates with Prometheus to provide rich, customizable visualizations of the metrics data.

- **Prometheus server** is the core of the monitoring system. It is responsible for scraping metrics from various configured targets, storing them in its time-series database (TSDB), and serving queries through its HTTP API
  - **Retrieval:** This module handles the scraping of metrics from endpoints, which are discovered either through static configurations or dynamic service discovery methods.
  - **TSDB (Time Series Database):** The data scraped from targets is stored in the TSDB, which is designed to handle high volumes of time-series data efficiently.
  - **HTTP Server:** This provides an API for querying data using PromQL, retrieving metadata, and interacting with other components of the Prometheus ecosystem.
  - **Storage:** The scraped data is stored on local disk (HDD/SSD) in a format optimized for time-series data

- **Service discovery** automatically identifies and manages the list of scrape targets (i.e., services or applications) that Prometheus monitors. This is crucial in dynamic environments like Kubernetes where services are constantly being created and destroyed.Components:
  - **Kubernetes:** In Kubernetes environments, Prometheus can automatically discover services, pods, and nodes using Kubernetes API, ensuring it monitors the most up-to-date list of targets.
  - **File SD (Service Discovery):** Prometheus can also read static target configurations from files, allowing for flexibility in environments where dynamic service discovery is not used.
 
- **Pushgateway** is used to expose metrics from short-lived jobs or applications that cannot be scraped directly by Prometheus. These jobs push their metrics to the Pushgateway, which then makes them available for Prometheus to scrape(pull).
  - Use Case: It's particularly useful for batch jobs or tasks that have a limited lifespan and would otherwise not have their metrics collected

- **Alertmanager** is responsible for managing alerts generated by the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing alerts to the appropriate notification channels such as PagerDuty, email, or Slack

- **Exporters** are small applications that collect metrics from various third-party systems and expose them in a format Prometheus can scrape. They are essential for monitoring systems that do not natively support Prometheus. Types of Exporters: 
Common exporters include the *Node Exporter (for hardware metrics)*, the *MySQL Exporter (for database metrics)*, and various other application-specific exporters.
