**Basics of PromQL**
- PromQL operates on time-series data and supports instant vector, range vector, scalar, and string types.
- Instant Vector: Fetches the latest value of a metric.
  ```bash
  node_cpu_seconds_total
  ```
- Range Vector: Fetches historical data within a time range.
  ```bash
  node_cpu_seconds_total[5m]
  ```
- Scalar: Returns a single numerical value.
  ```bash
  scalar(node_memory_MemTotal_bytes)
  ```

**Aggregation Functions**

**Rate, Increase, and Delta Functions**
- These functions operate on range vectors.

**Filtering and Label Matching**

The **sum by (label)** function in PromQL is used to sum up metric values while preserving a specific label. It helps in aggregating data but keeps certain labels so that you can see meaningful groupings in your query results.
```bash
sum by (label) (metric)
```

Example: Summing CPU Usage Per Job
- Consider a metric cpu_usage that has multiple instances across different jobs.

```bash
sum by (job) (cpu_usage)
```
