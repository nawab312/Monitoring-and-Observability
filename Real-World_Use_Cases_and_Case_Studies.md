Your team notices that the response time of a microservice has increased significantly during peak hours. 
You have Prometheus and Grafana set up for monitoring. How would you diagnose the issue and identify the root cause using these tools?

**SOLUTION**

I would approach this problem systematically by breaking it down into key performance indicators (KPIs) and analyzing the metrics collected by Prometheus
- Verify the Issue Using Grafana Dashboards. I would start by opening Grafana and looking at the microservice response time dashboard. If we have already set up latency metrics using Prometheus, I would check:
  - HTTP request duration (histogram/summary metrics)
  - 95th or 99th percentile latency trends
  - Error rates (HTTP 5xx, 4xx responses)
  - If the response time is indeed spiking during peak hours, I would confirm the exact time range and correlate it with other system metrics.
- Drill Down into Prometheus Metrics. Next, I would use PromQL queries in Prometheus to drill deeper into the issue. Some useful queries would be:
  - Check HTTP request duration. This tells me if the latency is high and whether it's affecting all requests or specific endpoints.
    ```bash
    histogram_quantile(0.95, rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m]))
    ```
  - Check request rate. If the request rate has increased significantly, it might indicate a load-related issue.
    ```bash
    rate(http_requests_total[5m])
    ```
  - Check error rate. This helps determine if the microservice is failing under load.
    ```bash
    rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])
    ```
  - Check CPU and memory usage of the microservice. If CPU or memory usage is maxing out, the service might be throttling.
    ```bash
    rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{pod=~"microservice.*"}[5m])
    ```
    ```bash
    container_memory_usage_bytes{pod=~"microservice.*"}
    ```
- Identify Bottlenecks Using Correlation Analysis. If I observe high latency, I would try to correlate it with other system metrics:
  - Database Queries:
    - If the microservice interacts with a database, I would check database response times using Prometheus exporters like MySQL/PostgreSQL exporter.
      ```bash
      rate(mysql_global_status_queries[5m])
      ```
    - Network Issues:
      - If the service depends on external APIs, I would check network latency and failures using Prometheus blackbox exporter.
    - Pod Scaling Issues (Kubernetes-based services):
      - If running in Kubernetes, I would check if Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is scaling pods correctly:
        ```bash
        count(kube_pod_info{namespace="production", pod=~"microservice.*"})
        ```
- Investigate Possible Solutions. Based on the findings, possible actions include:
  - If CPU/memory is maxing out: Increase resource limits or optimize code.
  - If the database is slow: Optimize queries, add indexing, or consider read replicas.
  - If traffic is too high: Implement caching (Redis), use load balancing, or increase replica counts.
  - If there are external API dependencies: Implement circuit breakers (e.g., Hystrix) to prevent cascading failures.
- Ensure Continuous Monitoring and prevent such issues in the future:
  - Implementing distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger) to track request flows.
  - Using service-level objectives (SLOs) to define acceptable latency/error budgets.
  - Automating scaling decisions with Kubernetes HPA based on Prometheus metrics
  - Conducting load testing with tools like Locust or JMeter to simulate peak traffic scenarios.
