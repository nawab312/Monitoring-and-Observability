**Observability** 
- Ability to understand the **internal state of a system(Application + Infra + Network)** by analyzing the data it produces, including logs, metrics, and traces. 
- With the help of Observability I can get following information:
  - What is the disk or CPU or Memory utilization of a particular node in my Kubernetes Cluster over the last 24 Hours. 
  - Out of 100 API Calls made to my application how many requests were success. It also involves why these API Requests are failing and how to fix them
- 3 Pillars of Observability:
  - **Monitoring(Metrics):** Involves tracking system metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and network performance. Provides alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions. Monitoring tells us what is happening.
  - **Logging(Logs):** Involves the collection of log data from various components of a system. Logging explains why it is happening.
  - **Tracing(Traces):** Involves tracking the flow of a request or transaction as it moves through different services and components within a system. Tracing shows how it is happening.
