## Logstash ##
An open-source server-side data processing pipeline that ingests, transforms, and forwards data to Elasticsearch, where it can be stored and queried.

### Logstash Architecture ###
- Input: Collects or receives data from a source (e.g., files, network ports, APIs).
- Filter: Processes and transforms the data (e.g., parsing, grok, enriching).
- Output: Sends the processed data to an output destination (e.g., Elasticsearch, files, stdout).
