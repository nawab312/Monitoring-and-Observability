**Optimizing Scrape Intervals and Retention**

*Scrape Intervals*
- The scrape interval determines how often Prometheus collects data from targets. Setting an optimal interval helps balance between granularity and performance.
- Best practices:
  - For high-frequency metrics (e.g., application performance, HTTP requests): 5-15s
  - For system-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory): 30s-1min
  - Avoid very short intervals (<1s) unless necessary, as it increases load.
  - Use different intervals per job using the `scrape_configs` section in `prometheus.yml`.
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "application_metrics"
    scrape_interval: 10s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["app-service:9090"]
```

*Retention Policies*
- Prometheus stores data in a time-series database. Long retention leads to increased storage and performance issues.
- Best practices:
  - Keep short-term retention in Prometheus (default: 15 days)
  - Use remote storage (e.g., Thanos, Cortex) for long-term retention.
  - Configure retention settings:
```bash
--storage.tsdb.retention.time=15d
--storage.tsdb.retention.size=10GB
```

**Writing Efficient PromQL Queries**
- Avoid using `rate()` on short time windows.
  - Instead of `rate(http_requests_total[1s])`, use `rate(http_requests_total[5m])`.
- Use `irate()` for fast-changing counters.
  - `irate(cpu_usage_seconds_total[1m])` is better for CPU spikes.
- Use aggregation functions to reduce data volume.
  - Example: `avg by (instance) (rate(http_requests_total[5m]))` instead of querying raw metrics.
- Use recording rules to store precomputed queries.
  - Instead of running expensive queries repeatedly, store results in Prometheus:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: recording_rules
    interval: 1m
    rules:
      - record: job:rate_http_requests:5m
        expr: rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```
