Prometheus provides alerting and notification features through Alertmanager. 
This allows you to define rules, trigger alerts based on conditions, and send notifications to various channels like Slack, Email, PagerDuty, or Webhooks.
Alertmanager sends notifications to configured channels like Slack, Email, or Webhooks.
**Introduction to Alertmanager**

Alertmanager is a component in the Prometheus ecosystem responsible for:
- Handling alerts generated by Prometheus.
- Grouping, deduplicating, and silencing alerts to reduce noise.
- Routing alerts to different destinations like Slack, Email, Webhooks, or PagerDuty.
- Providing alert escalation and inhibition to prevent unnecessary notifications.

**Configuring Alerting Rules in Prometheus**

Prometheus does not generate alerts on its own—it only collects and monitors data. To trigger alerts, you need to define alerting rules in Prometheus.

Alerting Rule Syntax
- Alerting rules are written in the Prometheus YAML configuration file (`prometheus.yml`) under the `rule_files` section.
- Example Alerting Rule: High CPU Usage
```yaml
groups:
  - name: CPUAlerts
    rules:
      - alert: HighCPUUsage
        expr: avg by (instance) (rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) < 0.2
        for: 2m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "High CPU Usage on {{ $labels.instance }}"
          description: "The CPU usage on instance {{ $labels.instance }} is above 80% for more than 2 minutes."
```
- `alert: HighCPUUsage` → Alert name.
- `expr:` → The PromQL expression.
  - `rate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])` measures CPU idle time over 5 minutes.
  - `avg by (instance) (...) < 0.2` triggers the alert if CPU idle time is less than 20%, meaning usage is above 80%.
- `for: 2m` → The alert is triggered only if the condition holds for 2 minutes (prevents false alarms).
- `labels:` → Defines metadata like severity (critical).
- `annotations:` → Provides additional information for alert messages.

Loading Alerting Rules into Prometheus
- To activate alerting rules, update `prometheus.yml` with:
```yaml
rule_files:
  - "alert_rules.yml"
```

**Alertmanager Configuration and Routing**

Once an alert is triggered, Prometheus sends it to Alertmanager, which routes it to the appropriate notification channel.

Configuring Alertmanager (`alertmanager.yml`)
- The main configuration file for Alertmanager (alertmanager.yml) defines:
  - Receivers (Slack, Email, Webhook, etc.)
  - Routing rules (how alerts are sent)
  - Grouping and inhibition rules
 
Example Configuration: Sending Alerts to Slack
```yaml
global:
  resolve_timeout: 5m

route:
  receiver: "slack_notifications"
  group_by: ['alertname', 'severity']
  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 3h

receivers:
  - name: "slack_notifications"
    slack_configs:
      - send_resolved: true
        channel: "#alerts"
        api_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/your-webhook-url"
        title: "{{ .CommonLabels.alertname }}"
        text: "{{ .CommonAnnotations.description }}"
```
- `global:`
  - `resolve_timeout: 5m` → Marks alerts as resolved after 5 minutes.
- `route:`
  - `receiver: "slack_notifications"` → Alerts are sent to the `slack_notifications` receiver.
  - `group_by: ['alertname', 'severity']` → Alerts with the same alertname and severity are grouped.
  - `group_wait: 30s` → Waits 30 seconds before sending the first alert (useful for short-lived alerts).
  - `group_interval: 5m` → If multiple alerts come in, sends updates every 5 minutes.
  - `repeat_interval: 3h` → If an alert persists, resend notifications every 3 hours.
 
**Sending Alerts to Different Notification Channels**

Slack Integration. To send alerts to Slack:
- Create a Slack Incoming Webhook → Go to Slack Webhooks and generate a URL.
- Update `alertmanager.yml` with the Slack api_url.
- Restart Alertmanager to apply changes.

Email Integration. To send alerts via Email:
```yaml
receivers:
  - name: "email_notifications"
    email_configs:
      - to: "admin@example.com"
        from: "alertmanager@example.com"
        smarthost: "smtp.example.com:587"
        auth_username: "alertmanager@example.com"
        auth_password: "your-email-password"
```

Webhook Integration
A Webhook allows sending alerts to a custom API endpoint for automation.
Example configuration:
```yaml
receivers:
  - name: "webhook_notifications"
    webhook_configs:
      - url: "http://your-api-endpoint/alerts"
        send_resolved: true
```

Final Workflow: How Alerts Flow from Prometheus to Notifications
- Prometheus evaluates alerting rules every few seconds.
- If an alert condition is met, Prometheus sends the alert to Alertmanager.
- Alertmanager groups, filters, and processes alerts based on the routing configuration.
- Alertmanager sends notifications to configured channels like Slack, Email, or Webhooks.
